Name node:

1-NameNode is the centerpiece of HDFS
2-Runs on a “master node” that tracks and directs the storage of the cluster.
3-Is is the Master node which is responsible for storing the meta-data for all the files and directories. 
4-It has information such as the blocks that make a file, and where are those blocks located in the cluster.
5-NameNode does not store the actual data or the dataset.
6-NameNode manages HDFS storage
7-To ensure high availability, we have both an active NameNode and a standby NameNode.
8-NameNode is usually configured with a lot of memory (RAM). Because the block locations are help in main memory.

Data node:

1-Runs on “slave nodes,” which make up the majority of the machines within a cluster. 
2-The NameNode instructs data files to be split into blocks, each of which are replicated three times and stored on machines across the cluster.
3-These replicas ensure the entire system won’t go down if one server fails or is taken offline—known as “fault tolerance.”
4-Stores actual data
5-When a DataNode starts up it announce itself to the NameNode along with the list of blocks it is responsible for.
6-When a DataNode is down, it does not affect the availability of data or the cluster. NameNode will arrange for replication for the blocks managed by the DataNode that is not available.
7-DataNode is usually configured with a lot of hard disk space. Because the actual data is stored in the DataNode.


Resource Manager:

1-The ResourceManager is responsible for tracking the resources in a cluster, and scheduling applications
2-This daemon process runs on master node (may run on the same machine as name node for smaller clusters)
3-It is responsible for getting job submitted from client and schedule it on cluster, monitoring running jobs on cluster and allocating proper resources on the slave node
4-It communicates with Node Manager daemon process on the slave node to track the resource utilization
5-It uses two other processes named Application Manager and Scheduler for MapReduce task and resource management
6-ResourceManager is the single point of failure in a YARN cluster


Node manager:

1-NodeManagers take instructions from the ResourceManager and manage resources available on a single node.
2-This daemon process runs on slave nodes (normally on HDFS Data node machines)
3-It is responsible for coordinating with Resource Manager for task scheduling and tracking the resource utilization on the slave node
4-It also reports the resource utilization back to the Resource Manager
5-It uses other daemon process like Application Master and Container for MapReduce task scheduling and execution on the slave node
